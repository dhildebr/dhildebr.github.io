# GitHub Pages :: Daniel Hildebrandt (dhildebr)

This repository, while capable of such, will not be used for hosting a personal website. For my portfolio site, visit [DanielHildebrandt.net](http://www.danielhildebrandt.net).

Instead, I intend to use this repository for the public-web hosting of web app assets, such as JSON and XML data. There's not much to see here, for human visitors.
